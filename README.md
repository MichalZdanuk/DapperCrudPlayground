# DapperCrudPlayground

A minimal .NET API utilizing **Dapper** for database access ‚Äî my first hands-on experience with Dapper.  
The goal was to build a very simple CRUD API to explore the basic capabilities of this lightweight ORM.

All code was written without the use of any large language models ‚Äî just good old-fashioned research through documentation, previous projects, StackOverflow, and blog posts.

### üèõÔ∏è Solution Overview

A lightweight, minimal API written in a clean and straightforward way. Endpoints are built on top of a service layer.

- The `MovieService` uses an abstraction for creating `DbConnection` instances with Dapper.
- Business logic for CRUD operations is encapsulated in the service.
- Mapster is used for simple object mapping between DTOs and domain models.
